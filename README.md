# Project-3-react-game-devLinkedin-backend
Welcome to the backend repository for IndieDevHub!

This platform is built using MongoDB, Express.js, and is designed for indie developers to connect with one another and share their skills and projects.

Users can sign up and create a profile listing their skillset, as well as post and browse projects that are searchable by skillset.
Users can also post comments on projects.

This repository contains the code for the server-side of the platform. It handles the database connections, user authentication, and the API endpoints for creating and retrieving user, project, and comment data.

We hope this platform helps indie developers connect and collaborate with one another. Happy coding!
